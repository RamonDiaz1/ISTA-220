## C# Programming Homework 02
1.What is a local variable?
* Variables that are local to the method in which they are declared. 

2.What is a statement?
* A statement is a command that performs an action, such as calculating a value and storing the result
or displaying a message to a user.

3.What is an identifier?
* Identifiers are the names that you use to identify the elements in your programs, such as namespaces,
classes, methods, and variables

4.What is a keyword?
* Keywords are identifiers that are used in C# language that cannot be reused for your own purpose.

5.What is a variable?
* A variable is a storage location that holds a value. You can think of a variable as a box in the computer’s
memory that holds temporary information.

6.How do you declare a variable? How do you assign a value to a variable? Can you have a variable that
does not have a value? Can you declare and initialize a variable in a single statement?
* When you declare a variable, you must specify the type of data it will hold
* To assign value you must declare the variable first then add value to it.
* You can not have a variable that does not have value in C# because a random value is assigned until you assign value to it. 

7.What does Visual Studio do when you open a project (a .csproj file) without opening the solution (a
.sln file)? Why might this be a problem?
* Visual Studio automatically creates a new solution file for it. 

8.How are arithmetic operators and variable types related?
* Operators can be used on values depending the type.

9.How do you turn an integer into a string?
* To convert a interger into an string you use the ToString() 

10.How do you turn a string into an integer?
* To convert a string into an interger you use the Int32.Parse method.

11.What is the difference between precedence and associativity? Give an example where this makes a
difference.
* Precedence governs the order in which an expression’s operators are evaluated, while associativity
is the direction (left or right) in which the operands of an operator are evaluated. this makes a difference
when  an expression contains different operators that have the same precedence.

12.What is the definite assignment rule?
* You must assign a value to a variable before you can use it; otherwise, your program will not compile.

13.How are the prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators evaluated differently?
* Whether you use the prefix or postfix form of the ++ or -- operator makes no difference to the
variable being incremented or decremented.

14.What is string interpolation?
*  Renders many uses of the + operator obsolete for concatenating strings. Alson, you can direct the computer to evaluate an expression to a string.

15.What does the var keyword do?
*  Causes the compiler to deduce the type of the variables from the types of the expressions
used to initialize them.
