## C# Programming Homework 01 

1.What is a console app? 
* A console app is an application that runs in a Command Prompt window 
instead of providing a graphical user interface (GUI).
 
2.List two differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core. Note that in this class, we will be 
writing C# applications in .NET Framework and ASP.NET applications in NET Core. 
* You use the .NET Core template for building portable applications that can also run on other operating systems, while .NET Framework 
is used for desktop and web applications. .NET Framework is older and only applies to windows, .Net Core is new, cross platform, and open source.
 
3.What does Main() (the main method) do in a console application? 
* The main method designates the programâ€™s entry point. 

4.Describe these three files: TextHello.sln, TextHello.csproj, and AssemblyInfo.cs. 
* TextHello.sln is a solution file, TextHello.csproj is a project file, AssemblyInfo.cs is a special file that you can use to add attributes to a program. 

5.What is the purpose of a namespace? 
*namespaces are used to avoid name clashes between classes of the same name. 

6.Describe specifically what using statements do. 
* using statements enable you to bring a class into scope and omit the class name when accessing static members. 

7.What is the entry point for a console app? What is the entry point for a UWP app? 
* The entry point for a console app is the main method. The entry point for a UWP app is App.xaml file. 

8.What is an assembly? 
* An assembly is a file that usually has the .dll file name extension, although strictly speaking, executable 
programs with the .exe file name extension are also assemblies. 

9.How many different versions of the WriteLine() method does the Console class contain? 
* it provides 19 different versions of this method. 

10.What is the relationship between an assembly and a namespace? 
* There is no relationship between the two.                                                                                                                     

11.What is a graphical app? 
* a graphical app is an application that provides a graphic user interface. 

12.What does Build do? 
* compiles the C# code. 

13.(Not in book) What is bytecode? What is Microsoft CIL? Do you think that CIL is bytecode? Why 
or why not? 
* Bytecode is a program code that has been compiled from source code into low-level 
code designed for a software interpreter. Microsoft CIL is the language of the .NET platform.  
CIL is a bytecode as it can be compiled into high level languages. 

14.What does Debug do? 
* spot problems that prevent your applications from working correctly.
