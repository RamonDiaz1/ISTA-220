## C# Programming Homework 04

1.What are all possible values of Boolean expression?
* Boolean values are true and false.

2.List the equality operators. List the relational operators. List the logical operators. How are they the
same? How are they different?
1. Equality operators are ==, !=
1. Relational operators are <, <=, >, >=
1. Logical operators are &&, ||, !
These operators assign value to an object, the value depends on the assignment operator

3.What is the general concept of short circuiting? This question has a short and simple answer and you
do not need to have a detailed response.
* A method for evaluating logical operators AND and OR.

4.What are the difference in how short circuiting works for && and ||?
* && ( double ampersand ) – Conditional AND operator
|| ( double pipeline) – Conditional OR operator

5.Look at the list of operators. What operator has the highest precedence? Which has the lowest?
* Primary operators such as (), ++, --, have higher precedence. The assignment operator = has the lowest precedence.

6.In an if or else construction using multiple lines of code, what effect does the use of curly braces have?
* It will perform more than one statement when a boolean expression is true.

7.In a switch statement, what happens if you omit break?
*  Execution runs as far as the break statement, at which point the switch statement finishes and the program continues at the first
statement that follows the closing brace of the switch statement.

8.The four keywords in a switch statement are switch, case, break, and default. Explain what each
keyword does.
1. Switch is a selection statement that chooses a single switch section to execute from a list of candidates based on 
a pattern match with the match expression. initiates the switch statement.
1. The case statement is part of the switch statement. This keyword is used inside switch statements of the C# programming language.
a label that compares the statement.
1. The break statement, at which point the switch statement finishes and the program continues at the first
statement that follows the closing brace of the switch statement.
1. The default statement specifies the default label in the switch statement. It can also be used as the default operator or literal to 
produce the default value of a type.

9.Look at the source listing below. It contains two methods: recurr1() and recurr2(). There is a
significant difference between the two methods. What is it?
* The difference between the two methods is one takes more memerory.

10.(Not in book) What is a recursive method? Using a language you know (such as English), write a
recursive method that adds up the integers in a list of integers. The input to the method is a list of
integers and the output is a scalar value representing a sum.
* A recursive method is a function that calls itself.

using System;

namespace Recursive
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Recursive example");
            int sumofnumbers = SumOfNumbers(10);
            Console.WriteLine(sumofnumbers);
        }

        private static int SumOfNumbers(int n)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"calling SumOfNumbers({n})");
            if (n == 0)
                return 0;
            else
                return n + SumOfNumbers(n - 1);
        }
    }
}

11.(Not in book) Read a short summary of De Morgan’s laws.
(a) Explain how this statement, ”It’s not snowing or raining,” is the same as this statement, ”It’s not
snowing and it’s not raining.”
* Both statements refere to the same subject & both statements are true. 

(b) Explain how this statement, ”I’m not running and walking,” is the same as this statement, ”I’m
not running or I’m not walking
* Both statements refere to the same subject & both statements are true.
