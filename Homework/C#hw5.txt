## C# Programming Homework Homework 05

1.What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?
*Compound-assignment operators provide a shorter syntax for assigning the result of an arithmetic or bitwise operator.
They work by combining any arithmetic operator with the assignment operator.

2.List all the compound assignment operators.
````
    += (compound addition assignment operator)
    -=  (compound subtraction assignment operator)
    *= (compound multiplication assignment operator)
    /= (compound division assignment operator)
    %= (compound modulo assignment operator)
    &= (compound Bitwise & assignment operator)
    |= (compound Bitwise | assignment operator)
    ^= (compound Bitwise ^ assignment operator)
    >>= (compound right-shift assignment operator)
    >>>=(compound right-shift filled 0 assignment operator)
    <<=(compound left-shift assignment operator)

3.List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.
* Use (++) for increments and (--) for decrement

4.How long does a while loop run?
* While loop will continue running unless you give it a stop value.

5.What is an iteratiion variable? (Not in book)
* A variable that changes each time the loop executes and controls when the loop finishes 

6.What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?
* only the first statement that immediately follows the Boolean expression in the while construct will be executed as part of the loop.

7.How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of
them? What happens if you omit all of them?
For loop statements have three parts, you can omit all of them, if you omit all of them you for loop  defaults
to true, so the following for statement runs forever:

8.How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
You initialize the statement.

9.What does the break statement do?
* Breaks out of a loop early.

10.What does the continue statement do?
* The continue statement passes control to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing do , for , or while statement in which it appears.

11.(Thought question) Can you think of any reason why you would want to have an infinite loop? An
“infinite loop” is a loop without an update variable that in effect runs forever. As you will see, these
kinds of loops are written intentionally to perform various kinds of tasks
